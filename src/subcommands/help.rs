If a local cache created by 'update' subcommand is present and up to date,
it will be used. Otherwise live data will be fetched from the crates.io API.

It's not guaranteed that the local cache will be used if '--cache-max-age' is
set to less than 48 hours, even if you've run 'update' subcommand just now.
That's because crates.io database dumps may not be updated every single day.

  --cache-max-age  The cache will be considered valid while younger than specified.
                   The format is a human readable duration such as `1w` or `1d 6h`.
                   If not specified, the cache is considered valid for 48 hours.

If the local cache is already younger than specified in '--cache-max-age' option,
a newer version will not be downloaded.

Note that this downloads the entire crates.io database, which is hundreds of Mb of data!
If you are on a metered connection, you should not be running the 'update' subcommand.
Instead, rely on requests to the live API - they are slower, but use much less data.
